# ComLab Project

This is my Computer Laboratory Project built with **PHP**, **MySQL**, and a **Spring Boot API** for reports.  

> **Note:** The UI uses Pixel Admin 2, but the template is **not included**. Some UI bugs exist, but the backend logic works.

- User login and session management  
- Dashboard to manage laboratories and peripherals

- **Spring Boot API** provides JSON reports

2. Run **Spring Boot API** (Reports & LogInUser).  
3. Open the **Login page** and log in.
